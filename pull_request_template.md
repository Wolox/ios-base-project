## Screencast ##

Drag and drop gif screen cast:
 * If you can prove the functionality using the simulator use [LICECap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record the screencast.
 * If the feature you are adding must be tested in a real device (you depend on bluetooth for example) use QuickTime to record the screencast. Check [this](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/record-iphone-screen-quicktime/) tutorial on how to record a screencast with Quicktime and then check [this](https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207) tutorial on how to convert the `.mov` to `.gif` file in order to be able to attach it to the pull request.
